A voting app full stack project for freeCodeCamp

Made with the help of typescript, express.js, mongodb, mongoose and chart.js. For full list of
dependencies check out package.json.

For demo purposes [https://ethereal.email/](https://ethereal.email/) is used for password requests.

## Install

1.  Run `cp .env.example .env` inside project directory.
2.  Adjust settings for your own environment inside `.env`

## Docker

Docker is used for managing MongoDB on local machine for development.

- `docker-compose up -d` to start in detached mode.
- `docker ps` to show running containers.
- `docker-compose stop` to stop all the services.
- `docker-compose down --rmi local --volumes` to remove all created docker assets for this project.

## Scripts

I used [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) for this project. Any other package manager will work.

### Building

- `pnpm run build` for production (using parcel-bundler)
- `pnpm run ci` for ci environments or as a backup build system (using rollup / node-sass)
- `pnpm run develop` for development (using ts-node)

### Testing

- `pnpm run test:e2e:open` for end-to-end testing with cypress (make sure the app is accessible on localhost)
- `pnpm run test` for jest unit tests

### Database

- `pnpm run db:seed` for seeding database with mock data
- `pnpm run db:reset` for deleting test database
